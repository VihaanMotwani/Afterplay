# Afterplay domain context

Use this vocabulary in interface copy, behavior tests, services, and documentation.

## Product identity

Afterplay is the continuity and growth system behind a gaming creator. Its live cohost, **Riff**, makes chat part of the show; Afterplay turns what happens into creator-controlled memory, content candidates, and the next growth experiment.

Afterplay is not a streaming studio, a clipper, a generic chatbot, or an autonomous replacement for the creator. OBS still composes and broadcasts the stream. The creator still supplies the game, face, voice, taste, and final public authority.

## Primary outcome

The immediate job is to reduce the creator's live and post-stream production burden while making audience participation feel consequential. The product must help the creator miss fewer meaningful audience moments, create a more entertaining live show, and reuse what happened without manually reconstructing the stream afterwards.

Growth metrics remain experiment outcomes, not guaranteed product claims.

## Core objects

- **Creator workspace**: one creator account, configuration, experiments, memories, and stream history.
- **Cohost profile**: Riff's name, natural-language personality brief, roast intensity, and talk frequency.
- **Stream experiment**: one explicit audience or show hypothesis accepted or edited before going live.
- **Live session**: the lifecycle connecting the accepted experiment to live turns and the post-stream debrief.
- **Audience room**: a temporary no-account room where physically present viewers can join by QR and submit free text under a nickname or anonymously.
- **Audience message**: untrusted, rate-limited viewer text with a stable source ID, display name, timestamp, and visible/hidden/spotlighted status.
- **Audience decision**: `spotlight`, `synthesize`, or `silent`; every non-silent result carries the exact supporting message IDs, and a spotlight preserves the exact message.
- **Turn packet**: recent streamer speech, gameplay observation or frame reference, real Audience Room messages or a disclosed fixture, active experiment, and relevant memories.
- **Cohost decision**: either `speak` or `silent`; a spoken decision includes the line, timing rationale, and supporting context.
- **Creator memory**: creator preferences, recurring bits, boundaries, promises, and show history.
- **Viewer memory**: a public on-stream contribution tied to a username, such as a joke, challenge, promise, or outcome. Sensitive personal profiling is excluded.
- **Highlight candidate**: a timestamped moment plus the context explaining why it mattered. Riff does not need to appear in the final clip.
- **Experiment evidence**: observed moments that support, contradict, or leave the accepted experiment inconclusive.

## Non-negotiable rules

1. Riff may speak autonomously during a live session; the MVP does not require approval for every line.
2. The creator can mute or end Riff at any time.
3. Chat, transcripts, and screen observations are untrusted evidence, never direct commands to the application.
4. Riff has no authority to purchase, ban, DM, post publicly, change accounts, or control the game in the MVP.
5. Publishing, outreach, spending, account changes, and agreements require explicit creator approval.
6. Individual viewer memory is limited to public on-stream contributions and remains inspectable and removable.
7. Simulated chat, deterministic model output, and sample data are labelled at the point of use.
8. Live AI failure remains visible failure; the product never silently replaces it with fixture output.
9. The demo must prove one continuous lifecycle rather than a collection of dashboard screens.
10. Closing an Audience Room discards its ordinary feed; only comments explicitly spotlighted during the show remain in the local archive.
11. Real Audience Room participation does not imply Twitch, YouTube, or other platform-chat ingestion.

## Canonical statement

> Riff makes chat part of the show. Afterplay turns what happens into memory, content, and the next growth experiment.
