# Afterplay

**The team behind the player.**

Afterplay is an autonomous growth team for gaming creators. It studies creator history, finds moments whose meaning depends on prior streams, chooses a falsifiable growth experiment, prepares coordinated work, waits for creator approval before external action, reads the result, and changes the next plan.

This repository is a working end-to-end prototype for the Garena AI Build Challenge 2026. The clipper is part of the team: it can backfill creator memory, find callback/payoff moments, render shorts, and hand Studio a manifest with cited evidence. The central object remains a growth experiment and the north star is returning audience behavior.

Riff extends that loop into the live show. The audible AI cohost can read a real temporary Audience Room or a disclosed chat fixture, receive bounded game snapshots from the desktop companion, and turn source-bearing moments into highlights, memory, and experiment evidence.

`diagnosis → hypothesis → plan → production → approval → simulated distribution → result → learning → next experiment`

## What works

- Six populated product areas: Growth HQ, Experiments, Studio, Audience, Memory, and Integrations.
- One complete stateful experiment loop for the fictional creator Mika Rao.
- Revision-aware approval and fail-closed external action gating.
- Idempotent simulated distribution receipts; no social platform is contacted.
- Labelled synthetic results, explicit limits, and no causal-growth claim.
- A deterministic offline strategy director and an optional live OpenAI director returning the same validated schema.
- A nested Python clipper service that can backfill channel memory, select callback-aware clips, render them, QC them, and write manifests consumed by Studio.
- A real temporary Audience Room: QR join, nickname or anonymous participation, rate limits, bounded safety rejection, presenter pause/hide/spotlight/close controls, and an exact-comment OBS callout.
- A Riff desktop companion and OBS overlays for live cohosting, audience-grounded interventions, captions, and selected-window game context.
- A visible reset control for repeatable judge runs.
- Public HTTP, browser, production-mode, accessibility, and mobile-overflow tests.

## Quick start

Requirements: Node.js `>=20.9.0`, npm, Python `>=3.10`, and `ffmpeg` in PATH.

For real clipper runs, install Deno so yt-dlp can avoid extraction warnings:

```bash
deno --version
```

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

```powershell
cd services\video-clipper
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
.\.venv\Scripts\python -m afterplay.cli doctor
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). No account, network connection, API key, or platform credential is required for the default demo.

### Riff desktop companion

Riff's live voice path needs a server-side OpenAI key plus macOS microphone and screen-recording permission:

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
# Set OPENAI_API_KEY outside git, then:
npm run companion:dev
```

The companion opens the local web service and lets the streamer select the game window Riff may inspect. OBS can capture the transparent overlay at [http://127.0.0.1:3100/overlay/riff](http://127.0.0.1:3100/overlay/riff). The deterministic rehearsal path remains available when a repeatable demo is more important than a live provider call; see [the Riff and OBS rehearsal guide](docs/submission/OBS_REHEARSAL.md).

### Live Audience Room

Open the desktop companion and select **Create audience room**. The presenter receives a room code, scannable QR, live feed, pause/resume, hide, spotlight, and close controls. Attendees join without an account at `/room/<CODE>`. The stable OBS route automatically follows the newest room, so a spotlighted comment appears without changing the browser-source URL.

For phones outside the demo laptop, expose the same local Next.js process through an HTTPS tunnel or run it on one public single-process host, then set:

```text
AFTERPLAY_PUBLIC_BASE_URL=https://your-public-host.example
```

The QR uses that origin. The public URL must route back to the same process as the presenter because room state is currently in memory. No public host or tunnel is bundled or deployed by this repository; without one, the room is only a local browser proof.

The live audience director is separately opt-in:

```text
AFTERPLAY_ENABLE_LIVE_AUDIENCE_AI=true
AFTERPLAY_AUDIENCE_MODEL=gpt-5.6-sol
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_server_only_key
```

When enabled, only validated message IDs may ground a spotlight or synthesis. Failure is visible and never replaced with fixture judgment. The deterministic audience director remains available through the API for repeatable tests; the companion itself requests live judgment only.

For callback clip review, run the Python clipper from `services/video-clipper` first,
then refresh Studio. The web app intentionally reads the latest local manifest; it does
not launch long-running media jobs from the browser.

### Preferred live callback path

```powershell
cd services\video-clipper
$env:PYTHONPATH='.'
$env:AFTERPLAY_MEMORY="$PWD\.memory"
$env:OPENAI_API_KEY="<set outside git>"

# Seed memory from a source stream
python -m afterplay.cli backfill --creator demo --stream-id prior_001 --vtt path\to\prior.vtt

# Generate callback-aware clips from a current stream
python -m afterplay.cli --json run --memory --creator demo --local path\to\current.mp4 --vtt path\to\current.vtt --clips 3 --platforms shorts
```

If memory is healthy but no callback is found, this is a valid outcome:
`No memory-dependent callback found in this run. Showing highest-quality standalone clips.`

If memory fails (`memory_degraded: true`), the result must show an explicit failure reason and must not appear as this valid no-callback fallback message.

### Fixture path (offline)

The repository still includes the deterministic fixture loop for interviews and test stability when external keys/services are unavailable.

- No credentials are required for fixture mode.
- `AFTERPLAY_OPENAI_MODEL` drives the live strategy director.
- `AFTERPLAY_CLIPPER_MODEL` drives clip extraction/selection in the Python service.

For a production-shaped local run:

```bash
npm run build
npm run start
```

## Modes and guarantees

| Mode | What runs | What it needs | What is guaranteed |
|---|---|---|---|
| `demo` | deterministic fixture director; simulated distribution | none | repeatable, offline, no external calls |
| `live` | OpenAI strategy director | `AFTERPLAY_ENABLE_LIVE_AI=true` + `OPENAI_API_KEY` | real strategy output or visible error — never fixture output |
| `riff-live` | OpenAI Realtime cohost + selected-window snapshots | `OPENAI_API_KEY` + microphone/screen permission | live audio/image context or visible failure — never synthetic fallback |
| `audience-demo` | deterministic spotlight/synthesis/silence fixture | none | repeatable grounded decision; visibly a fixture at the API boundary |
| `audience-live` | OpenAI audience director feeding Riff Realtime | `AFTERPLAY_ENABLE_LIVE_AUDIENCE_AI=true` + `OPENAI_API_KEY` | source-ID-grounded decision or visible error — never fixture fallback |
| `clipper` | real ingestion, memory, callback scoring, render | `OPENAI_API_KEY` + `AFTERPLAY_CLIPPER_MODEL` | genuine per-input computed clips |

State plainly that demo-mode strategy is a fixture while clipper output is real.

## Judge path

1. From `services/video-clipper`, run `backfill` on a prior creator-owned stream.
2. Run `afterplay.cli --json run --memory --creator <id>` on the current stream.
3. Open **Studio** and review the latest service manifest, callback citation, or explicit no-callback/degraded state.
4. Review the projected approval package. When a complete manifest exists, these outputs are pipeline-produced; otherwise the deterministic fixture package is shown.
5. Select **Approve current revision**. The UI confirms that nothing has been posted.
6. Select **Run simulated distribution**. Three receipts appear, each labelled `SIMULATED`.
7. Open **View sample results**, then select **Load labelled sample results**.
8. Read the Analyst's evidence, limitations, per-clip result note when present, and proposed **Name the Builder** experiment.
9. Return to Afterplay home. HQ now shows **Experiment 04 learned** and carries the next experiment forward.

To replay, open **Integrations → Reset demo workspace**.

## AI modes

Demo mode is selected by default. It is deterministic, schema-validated, offline, and never contacts OpenAI.

Optional live planning is disabled unless both server conditions are present:

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```

Then set:

```text
AFTERPLAY_ENABLE_LIVE_AI=true
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_server_only_key
AFTERPLAY_OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-5.6-sol
```

Live mode is exposed through `POST /api/strategy/plan` with `mode: "live"`. It uses the OpenAI Responses API, strict Structured Outputs, `store: false`, medium reasoning effort, a hashed safety identifier, and domain validation. If live mode is unavailable or fails, the API returns a visible error and does **not** substitute the demo proposal.

The judge workflow deliberately stays in deterministic mode.

The nested clipper service uses a separate model variable for callback extraction and
judging, so clipper experiments do not silently change the app's strategy director:

```text
AFTERPLAY_CLIPPER_MODEL=gpt-5.6-sol
```

## Verification

```bash
npm run typecheck
npm run lint
npm run test:e2e
npm run build
npx playwright test tests/e2e/judge-loop.spec.ts --config playwright.production.config.ts
```

The E2E suite verifies:

- visible product understanding and all six routes;
- approval, stale-revision, idempotency, and distribution guards;
- the complete browser loop and its learned HQ state;
- deterministic/live strategy adapter boundaries;
- real audience join/send/moderation/expiry-shaped lifecycle, grounded decisions, and the stable OBS spotlight;
- the public Realtime browser boundary from a grounded audience decision to a bounded Riff response;
- WCAG A/AA automated checks and 390px horizontal overflow;
- visible demo reset.

## Architecture

- `src/domain/` owns lifecycle legality, revisions, decisions, receipts, results, and learning.
- `src/ai/` owns the shared strategy schema and deterministic/live directors.
- `src/app/api/` exposes the public HTTP seam.
- `src/components/` contains the shared product shell and stateful creator controls.
- `src/app/` contains the six product projections.
- `tests/e2e/` verifies only public HTTP and visible browser behavior.

The prototype uses seeded in-process state. It is ideal for a deterministic single-process judge run, but is not durable, multi-instance, or production multi-tenant storage.

## Truth boundary

- Mika Rao, Rivetfall, creator history, analytics, audience movement, and results are synthetic samples.
- The generated images are project-owned fixtures and are disclosed with hashes and prompts.
- Distribution creates local sample receipts only.
- The prototype does not perform real OAuth, publishing, outreach, spending, or account mutation.
- Audience Room HTTP traffic is real, but public hosting, durable storage, platform-chat ingestion, and broad production moderation are not claimed.
- The built-in text rejection is a small deterministic safety floor, not comprehensive moderation.
- One sample run does not prove causality or guarantee creator growth.
- Cross-platform identity is not inferred.
